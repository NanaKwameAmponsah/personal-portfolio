          <h3>Azure Honeypot SOC & Security Hardening Project</h3>
          <p>
Deployed a mini honeynet in Microsoft Azure consisting of 2 Windows VMs, 1 Linux VM, a Virtual Network, Network Security Group (NSG), Azure Key Vault, and a Storage Account.
Configured Azure Monitor Agent to forward Windows SecurityEvent logs, Linux Syslog, and NSG Flow Logs into a centralized Log Analytics Workspace (LAW).
Developed KQL queries to detect failed login attempts  and enriched logs with GeoIP threat intelligence.
Integrated Microsoft Sentinel for analytics: created alert rules (e.g. failed RDP auth, Linux SSH auth failure), used attack map visualizations, and set up incident generation.
Collected baseline metrics over 24 hours in an insecure environment, then applied security hardening and measured results for another 24 hours.

          <h3>Log Analysis with SIEM </h3>
          <p>
Investigated Windows Event Logs to detect suspicious outbound connections, identifying a malicious process communicating with IP and extracting its MD5 hash.
Analyzed Linux authentication logs in Splunk to trace persistence activity: identified account creation timestamp, privilege escalation by user, and multiple failed login attempts from an IP address.
Detected brute-force web attacks by analyzing server logs and identifying abnormal request patterns and attacker tools.
Documented indicators of compromise (IOCs) and classified attacker tactics including persistence, brute force, and privilege escalation.
